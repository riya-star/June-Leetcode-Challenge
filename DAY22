Main Idea: we will bitwise add every bit of the numbers present in the array and % it by 3 , the one's which are not a multiple of 3 are the bits
which occur once in the array.



class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        
          int result = 0;  
  
    int x, sum;  
  
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++)  //Here we are taking 32 bit number(assumption)
    {  
    
    sum = 0;  
    x = (1 << i);  
    for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++ )  
    {  
        if (nums[j] & x)  
            sum++;  
    }  
  
    if (sum % 3)  
        result |= x;  
    }  
  
    return result;  
    
        
    }
};
